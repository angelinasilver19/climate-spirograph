# Climate Spirograph Project Rules

BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK:
Read these files in order:
1. docs/PRD.md - What we're building
2. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - How it's structured  
3. docs/AI_RULES.md - Non-negotiable constraints
4. docs/PLAN.md - Step-by-step build instructions

## Core Rules:
- Use ONLY p5.js + vanilla JavaScript (NO frameworks)
- NO build tools (npm, webpack, etc.)
- Three variables ONLY: r (daily), d (hourly), thickness (hourly)
- Anchorage only, 1976 vs 2026 comparison
- Real NOAA data only (no mock data in production)
- Follow PLAN.md step-by-step (ONE step at a time)

## Workflow:
1. Read current step in PLAN.md
2. Generate code
3. Tell Angelina to test in browser
4. Fix any issues
5. Mark step as DONE
6. Move to next step

Angelina is learning to code. Be patient, explain clearly, test frequently.
